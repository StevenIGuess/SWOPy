# Swopy

Automated bot that webscrapes Swop and send messages via Telegramm.\
Swopy works by scraping the requiered data from swop, then parses it and sends it via different bot APIs

## Plans

- connect with db to enable files download via links
- add bot commands for graphs and other
- dockerize
- add external bots for dc
- Add Sms support
- Add Discord support

## Issues

- Discord needs to run permanently to listen to request -> Multithreading or external


## Quickstart 
Edit ./auth/auth_template.json\
cd to src\
Python3 main.py (make sure you have packages installed)
